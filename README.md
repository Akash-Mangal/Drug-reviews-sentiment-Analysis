# Drug-reviews-sentiment-Analysis
The sentiment analysis on drug reviews project aimed to build a
model to classify reviews of drugs as positive or negative based on their
textual content. The dataset was preprocessed, cleansed, and split into
training and testing sets. Two machine learning algorithms, Support
Vector Machines (SVM) and Naive Bayes, were trained on the dataset
and evaluated based on their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

The SVM model achieved an accuracy of 0.85. The Naive Bayes model
achieved an accuracy of 0.77. Therefore, the SVM model
outperformed the Naive Bayes model in terms of accuracy.

In conclusion, the sentiment analysis on drug reviews project
successfully built a model that can accurately classify reviews of drugs
as positive or negative. The SVM model performed better than the Naive
Bayes model and can be used to classify drug reviews for various
purposes such as monitoring drug safety, improving drug efficacy, and
enhancing patient care.
